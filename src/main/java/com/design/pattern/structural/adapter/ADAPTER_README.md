# Adapter Design Pattern

## Overview

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. In a typical use case, the Adapter Pattern wraps a legacy system or a third-party service and makes it compatible with a modern interface, without changing its existing code.

### What is the Adapter Design Pattern?

The Adapter Pattern allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by using a "wrapper" that translates one interface into another. It helps in integrating legacy or third-party systems into your current system seamlessly.

### When to Use the Adapter Pattern

- **Integrating Legacy Systems**: When you have legacy systems that you can't modify, and you need to integrate them with new code that uses a different interface.
- **Third-Party APIs**: When third-party APIs have different method signatures from the interface used in your system.
  
#### When Not to Use It

- **Unnecessary Overhead**: If the interfaces are already compatible, adding an adapter adds unnecessary complexity.
- **Increased Memory Usage**: In cases where multiple adapters are involved, the memory footprint can increase due to the additional layer of abstraction.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros:
- **Flexibility**: Allows you to reuse existing systems without modifying their code.
- **Loose Coupling**: Decouples the client from specific implementations of a service, making the code more maintainable.
  
#### Cons:
- **Performance Overhead**: The additional layer may cause slight performance degradation.
- **Complexity**: Can make the system more complex, especially with multiple adapters.

### Real-World Use Cases

1. **Payment Gateway Integration**: Wrapping a legacy payment gateway into an adapter so that it works with a modern e-commerce platform.
2. **Database Adapters**: Adapting a legacy database interface to work with modern ORM frameworks.
3. **Third-Party Libraries**: When integrating third-party APIs with incompatible interfaces into a standard system interface.

### Example cURL Commands

#### Process Payment Using Legacy System (via Adapter):
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/processPayment?details=LegacyPayment"
```
## Impact on Memory Footprint
Using the Adapter Pattern introduces an extra layer, which can result in additional memory usage, particularly if multiple adapters are created. While this typically has minimal impact in small-scale systems, for larger systems or high-performance environments, this additional memory overhead may need to be considered.

## more info
The Adapter Design Pattern is a great choice when you need to integrate legacy systems or third-party services that do not conform to the interface of your system. It increases flexibility, reduces coupling, and allows for smoother transitions between old and new code.
