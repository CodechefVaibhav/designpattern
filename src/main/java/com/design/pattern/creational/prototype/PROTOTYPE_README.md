# Prototype Design Pattern in Spring Boot

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the Prototype Design Pattern in a Spring Boot application. The Prototype Pattern is particularly useful when creating new instances of an object is a costly operation, and we want to avoid creating identical objects repeatedly. Instead of creating new objects, the Prototype Pattern allows us to clone existing ones.

## Prototype Design Pattern

### What is the Prototype Design Pattern?

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that involves creating new objects by copying or cloning an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is high, or the process is complex.

### When to Use It

- When object creation is expensive in terms of time or resources.
- When objects are similar but not identical, requiring slight modifications to existing objects.
- When we want to avoid the overhead of creating new objects from scratch every time.

### Memory Footprint

Using the Prototype Pattern can significantly reduce the memory footprint of an application by reusing existing objects and modifying them as needed. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large or complex objects.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Reduces the need for repetitive object creation.
- Can simplify object creation logic.
- Improves performance by avoiding expensive object creation.

**Cons:**
- Cloning complex objects can lead to challenges if deep copy is required.
- Maintaining the prototype can become cumbersome if not managed correctly.
- Potential issues with object mutation if not handled properly.

### Real-World Use Cases

- Creating document templates where each document is similar with slight variations.
- Game development for cloning characters, enemies, or other game objects with similar properties.
- In graphical applications, to clone shapes or other graphic elements.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the application using the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
