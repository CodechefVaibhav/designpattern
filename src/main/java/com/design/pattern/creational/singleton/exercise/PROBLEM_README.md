# Singleton Pattern Problem

## Problem
In a multi-threaded environment, if a configuration class is instantiated multiple times, it can lead to inconsistent configuration states, where different parts of the application might have different configurations.

## Impact
The application could behave unpredictably due to configuration mismatches, leading to bugs that are hard to trace and resolve.

## Solution-Explanation
The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the configuration class exists across the entire application. This guarantees consistent configuration management and helps avoid the issues mentioned above.
